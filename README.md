CGoL
====

A simple Conway's Game of Life written in Julia and also implemented in IJulia

Run: After cloning, be sure to create a folder where the pictures will be placed, ./GoLpics, or change the location where the files are to be placed in the savefig command.

There is a dependency on ffmpeg being installed to create the video. otherwise you can open the png's real quick in sucession and get a flip book type of animation.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.
